   <para>The WiFiDog project is a complete and embeddable captive portal solution for wireless community groups or individuals who wish to open a free Hotspot while still preventing abuse of their Internet connection.</para>
   <para>The WiFiDog project was started by {@link http://www.ilesansfil.org/ Ile sans fil} and is currently {@link http://auth.ilesansfil.org/ in production}. Existing captive portal solutions were either almost impossible to embed ({@link http://lists.nocat.net/mailman/listinfo NoCat}, which relies on Perl, GnuPG , OpenSSL ), or only designed to display disclaimers with no access control at all (NoCatSplash and others). WiFiDog is designed to have optional centralized access control, full bandwidth accounting, node heartbeating and local content specific to each hotspot. It does not rely on a JavaScript window, so it works with any platform with a web browser, including PDAs and cellphones. It is developed in C to make it easy to include in embedded systems (It has been designed for the {@link http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&packedargs=c%3DL_Product_C2%26cid%3D1127782957298&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper Linksys WRT54G}, but runs on any recent Linux platform). A typical install only takes 30kb on i386, and a fully functionnal install could be made in under 10 kb if necessary.</para>
